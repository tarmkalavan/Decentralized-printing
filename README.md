# Decentralized-print

Enabling autonomous and open-for-all printing ecosystem using Ethereum smart contract. \
\
Final project for 2110595 ADV. TOPICS IN COMPUTER ENGINEERING (BLOCKCHAIN).

# Project Info
This project aims to serve as a protocol to connect between printer owners and those with documents to be printed. \
The parties involved are as follows:
  - `Users` : (or customers) want to print some documents.
  - `Providers` :  (or printer owners) want to offer a printing service, in exchange for some $$$.

The project is structured as follows:
  - `contract` : contains all the files related to smart contracts (implemented in Solidity using Hardhat). Transaction contract represents a printing order, Printer contract represents a printer and CentralServer acts as a printer registry, keeping track of the open printers.
  - `frontend` : contains the code for the frontend UI. Although users may interact with contracts directly (or however they wish), this web UI was created for convenience and demostration purposes.
  - `printer-node` : contains the code for integrating a printer with our project. This was implemented in Go.
